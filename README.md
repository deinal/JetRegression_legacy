# JetRegression_legacy
JetRegression project repository.

Operates on CMS Open Data jetNtuples. Uses PFCandidate level information to try and learn jet energy corrections.

After cloning the repository, run it by executing main.py.

Note: Running the code for the first time will take significantly longer than in the subsequent runs. This is due to the datasets being downloaded from Open Data portal and formatted. Estimation is for this process to take O(1 hour).
